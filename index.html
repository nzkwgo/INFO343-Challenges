    <p><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Curry_(Prime_Earth)"><cite>Aquaman,</cite></a> also known as Arthur Curry, is a superhero from DC Comics. Aquaman is the king of Atlantis and other undersea territories, and a founding member of the Justice League. His abilities include super-strength, durability, super-speed, staying underwater indefinitely, and telepathy, which he uses to communicate and control with sea-life. His aquatic nature means he requires water regularly at the risk of dehydration, although he is perfectly capable of staying on land for extended periods.</p>
